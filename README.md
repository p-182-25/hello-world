# hello-world
 my github repository #1
This is basically the begining of my journey with programming. I started from learning C# in July 2017 and my goal is to reach Junior-Developer level until the end of March 2018. Simultaneously I'd like to get familiar with Java, as those 2 languages have a lot in common.
My ultimate goal is to become a solid App-Developer with advance knowledge of C# and Java, supported by the idea of TDD programming and "Clean Code" until the end of March 2019 or sooner :)
In the meantime I'd also like to know the basics of Full-Stack Web-Development (PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JS).
